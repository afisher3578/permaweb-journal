The Vouch Protocol is a decentralized system for **proving identity and building trust** within the Arweave and AO ecosystems. It helps prevent **Sybil attacks**, where a single entity creates multiple fake accounts to manipulate a system. By using the Vouch Protocol, we can verify that entities (such as users, wallets, or organizations) are real and trustworthy.

## Why Does Sybil Resistance Matter?

In decentralized networks, Sybil attacks undermine fairness and security by allowing one person to act as multiple fake users. **Sybil resistance** protects these systems by verifying and limiting fake identities. The Vouch Protocol provides a standardized way to achieve this.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Trust**: Confidence levels are determined collaboratively by VouchDAO members, ensuring no single party has control.
- **Customizable Verification**: Supports multiple methods, including social media, email, and KYC.
- **Interoperability**: Works seamlessly with other AO and Arweave processes.

**How to Use the Vouch Protocol**

- **Vouching**: Link wallets with trusted verification methods and submit them to the VouchDAO
- **Staking**: DAO members stake tokens to vote on the reliability of vouched wallets.
- **Confidence Scores**: Use confidence scores to evaluate trustworthiness for applications, services, or transactions.

## Vouch Portal

The [Vouch Portal](https://vouch-portal.arweave.net/#/) is an open-source reputation system on AO that calculates a **humanity score** using a mix of:

- **AO ecosystem data**
- **Ethereum blockchain activity**
- **Web2 social presence**

### Key Benefits:

- Verifies genuine users for enhanced security.
- Rewards reputation with prioritized benefits.
- Encourages positive ecosystem behavior.

### Adoption

Vouch is currently used by **Bazar**, **Llama Land**, and **Permaverse**. Other permaweb apps can integrate Vouch through the [Developer Docs](https://vouch-portal.arweave.net/#/developers).

### How to Earn Vouch Points

**1. Vouch X**

- Link your Twitter/X account.
- Points are awarded based on account criteria, such as age and activity.
- Each Twitter/X account can only be linked once.

**2. Vouch Gitcoin Passport**

- Use [Gitcoin Passport](https://app.passport.xyz/) to aggregate blockchain activity, social profiles, and KYC data.

**3. Vouch AO Balance**

- Earn points by holding AO tokens, bridging stETH, or holding DAI in the [AO pre-bridge](https://ao.arweave.net/#/mint).
- This method is valid until AO becomes tradable (~Feb 2025).

**4. Stake wAR**

- Earn additional points by staking wAR in the [Vouch Portal](https://vouch-portal.arweave.net/#/).
- Points vary by staking duration and AR price. Tokens are securely stored and can be withdrawn after the lock period. See the staking contract [here](https://www.ao.link/#/entity/zYBcGWB4KJeB4pc04XiNOKrD0DQBPelvNBbfDnqiunQ).

## Summary

The Vouch Protocol is a **decentralized proof-of-humanity system** that helps build trust by verifying identities within the AO ecosystem. It plays a vital role in protecting against fake accounts, ensuring fairness, and enabling more secure decentralized applications.
