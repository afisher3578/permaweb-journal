Arweave is the first protocol to enable **permanent data storage**, allowing users to preserve data forever with a single, one-time fee. Curious about how it works and why it matters? Let’s explore.

## What is Arweave?

Arweave is a decentralized protocol designed for **permanent storage** of data. Instead of relying on recurring payments like traditional cloud services, Arweave requires a one-time payment to store your data forever.

The protocol is secured by a network of miners who store and replicate data in exchange for rewards in the AR token. These rewards are funded through Arweave’s storage endowment, ensuring your data is always accessible, backed by an immutable and transparent economic model.

At its core is the permaweb, a global, unbounded web of pages and applications that exist permanently, free from centralized control

## How does Arweave work?

Arweave’s design combines an unique data structure called the **blockweave** with an economic model based on a sustainable storage endowment. Here’s a simplified breakdown:

- **Data Storage**: When you upload data, it’s bundled into blocks and added to the blockweave, a blockchain-like structure optimized for storage.
- **Proof of Access ([SPoRA](https://github.com/ArweaveTeam/arweave-standards/blob/master/ans/ANS-103.md))**: Miners must verify not only new data but also randomly selected older data to create new blocks. This ensures data is continually replicated and remains available.
- **[Storage Endowment](storage-endowment.md)**: Your one-time payment contributes to a long-term fund, enabling miners to store your data indefinitely as storage costs decrease over time.
