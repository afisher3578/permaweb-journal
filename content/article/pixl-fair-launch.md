PIXL has been the rewards token of the [Universal Content Marketplace (UCM)](ucm.md) and used in [Bazar](https://bazar.arweave.net/#/)for the past year and a half, distributed strictly through user engagement incentives. Now, with **15,531,330.5888 PIXL** already minted, the remaining supply is being reallocated: **75%** for the Permaweb Index (PI) Fair Launch and **25%** for ongoing daily engagement rewards.

## I. PIXL tokenomics

- **Max Supply**: 26 million units.
- **Minting Model**: Bitcoin-like halving schedule.
- **Distribution**:
  - 75% allocated to the PI Fair Launch.
  - 25% reserved for continued engagement rewards.

This ensures a fair distribution while keeping incentives aligned with long-term participation in the ecosystem.

## II.Fair launch allocation breakdown

At **block 1,628,189**, the total circulating supply was **15,531,330.5888 PIXL**. Using the fair launch allocation formula:

- **FAIR_LAUNCH_SUPPLY** = (Max Supply - Current Minted) \* 0.75
- **Fair Launch Allocation**: **8,061,502.0584 PIXL**
- **Remaining for Daily Rewards**: **2,687,167.3528 PIXL**

This gradual release balances long-term incentive structures with the fair launch distribution.

## III. Daily engagement rewards breakdown

PIXL is distributed to users who engage with atomic asset purchases on UCM platforms like Bazar. Buying streaks determine a user’s reward share:

- **Streaks**: Consecutive days of purchasing atomic assets increase a user's PIXL share.
- **Weight system**: Rewards start at a base weight of **1** and increase by **0.1 per day**, up to a max weight of **4** at 30 days.
- **Reset mechanism**: After 30 days, streak weight resets to **1**, ensuring continuous participation.

PIXL launched on **August 2, 2023**, at [block height 1,232,228](https://viewblock.io/arweave/block/1232228). It follows a daily minting cycle with a halving mechanism, ensuring a gradual and predictable token distribution. Now that the remaining daily rewards allocation is **2,687,167.3528 PIXL**, this is the updated yearly rewards distribution.

- **Year 1**: 7,360 PIXL per day
- **Year 2**: 3,680 PIXL per day
- **Year 3**: 1,840 PIXL per day
- **Year 4**: 920 PIXL per day
- **Year 5**: 460 PIXL per day

This structured emission model incentivizes consistent user engagement while aligning with the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem.

### PIXL burn mechanism

To ensure long-term sustainability and scarcity:

- A **0.5% UCM fee** is collected (Bazar itself takes no fees).
- If transactions involve **wAR**, fees are used to **buy PIXL** from available orders.
- The purchased PIXL is **burned**, reducing supply over time.

Higher trading volumes lead to increased buy pressure and more PIXL burned, aligning incentives for active participation.

## IV. How to allocate AO yield to ecosystem projects

Bazar is one of six ecosystem projects participating in the Permaweb Index, with more to be added soon. To allocate AO yield to earn PIXL and other ecosystem project tokens:

1. Visit [AO Mint](https://ao.arweave.net/#/mint/deposits/).
2. Choose the fair launch projects to allocate yield to.
3. Adjust allocation under “Details & Add.”
4. Save changes.

More details on AO yield delegation are available [here](ao-yield.md).

## V. Conclusion

With its Bitcoin-like halving model and streak-based reward system, PIXL continues to incentivize meaningful engagement with atomic assets, reinforcing the decentralized marketplace’s growth. As AO yield allocation expands and new projects join the Permaweb Index, PIXL remains a core asset driving network activity and value accrual.

For those looking to participate, now is the time to engage, earn, and contribute to the evolution of the decentralized content economy.
