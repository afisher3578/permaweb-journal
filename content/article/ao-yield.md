The **Permaweb Index** launches on **3.14 (Pi Day)**, introducing a new model for funding crypto projects. Users can allocate their AO yield to Permaweb Index projects to earn PI tokens. This guide explains how to allocate AO yield step by step.

## What is the Permaweb Index?

The [Permaweb Index](https://ao.arweave.net/#/mint/deposits/) introduces a **fair launch funding mechanism**, allowing the community to support projects while enabling builders to secure sustainable development funding.

The **PI token** acts as a default means of exchange across the permaweb, offering broad exposure to the ecosystem without requiring active management. Each PI token represents ownership in key permaweb assets:

- **33.3% $AR** (Arweave)
- **33.3% $AO** (AO)
- **33.3% Fair launch projects**

More info on the Permaweb Index [here](permaweb-index.md)

## How does AO yield work?

Your **AO allocation** is determined by a combination of:

- Your Arweave (AR) holdings in a self-custody wallet
- Your deposited assets (e.g., stETH, DAI)

When you bridge stETH or DAI to AO, your original deposit remains in a trustless, audited contract on Ethereum while the native yield is distributed to support ecosystem projects and builders, helping fuel AO’s growth. Your assets can be withdrawn at any time.

More info on the economics of AO [here](https://mirror.xyz/0x1EE4bE8670E8Bd7E9E2E366F530467030BE4C840/-UWra0q0KWecSpgg2-c37dbZ0lnOMEScEEkabVm9qaQ).

## How to deposit stETH and DAI to accrue AO

1. **Go to the** [AO Mint page](https://ao.arweave.net/#/mint/deposits/).
2. **Connect ETH Wallet** in the **Deposits** section.
3. **Deposit stETH or DAI** by entering the amount.
   - If you don’t have **stETH** or **DAI**, swap other tokens for stETH or DAI before depositing.
4. **Enter the Arweave wallet address** where you want to receive AO tokens.
5. **Sign the transaction** in your Ethereum wallet to confirm the deposit.
6. **Receive AO tokens** directly in your Arweave wallet.

## How to allocate AO yield

AO allows you to customize how you allocate your yield. On the **Yield page**, you can choose:

- **PI:** Receive a diversified allocation: 1/3 AO, 1/3 Arweave (AR), 1/3 ecosystem project tokens
- **AO:** Keep earning AO. Your AR holding yield and deposits will continue accruing AO without reallocation.
- **AR:** Convert your AO yield into Arweave (AR), which can be used for permanent data storage.

### Fair Launch token customization

Under **“Choose Your Yield”**, you can further customize by selecting specific **fair launch projects** to allocate your yield.

- Click **Details & Add** under a project description to allocate AO yield to that project.
- The **PI allocation chart** (on the right) updates in real time.
- Once satisfied with your allocation, click **Save Changes**.

### What does it mean to allocate AO yield to fair launch projects?

Allocating your AO yield to an ecosystem project directs your accrued yield to fund its development. In return, you receive the project’s fair launch token, giving you a stake in its growth. This model ensures a more equitable funding system, allowing builders to raise capital without traditional gatekeepers while letting users participate in the project’s early success.

## Summary

The Permaweb Index introduces a new model for funding crypto projects. By allocating AO yield to Permaweb Index projects, users earn PI tokens, which provide diversified exposure to key permaweb assets.

When the Permaweb Index is live on PI Day (3.14) users can customize their yield allocation to receive AO, AR, PI, or specific fair launch project tokens, ensuring a flexible and fair funding mechanism for both builders and the community.
