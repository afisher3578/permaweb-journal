With rapid advancements in computing and AI, humanity’s acceleration into cyberspace is inevitable. But what does that mean for our online spaces, our physical spaces, and what it means to be human?

Most of our digital world is controlled by a handful of tech oligopolies, where governments and corporations surveil without permission and algorithms shape perception of reality. We face a choice: accept an internet dictated by a select few, one that rewrites history, fosters division, and leaves us unfulfilled, or consciously build a new web from the ground up.

Arweave grants the right to remember in a world that forgets. AO grants the right to boundless computing in a world constrained by centralization. Together, they form the permaweb, a freer internet that safeguards the right to speech and access to information, ensuring the world’s knowledge is permanently secure.

I’m excited to soft launch _[The Permaweb Journal](https://permaweb-journal.arweave.net/)_, an online publication and knowledge hub dedicated to covering the Arweave and AO ecosystem. This journal will track the latest developments in the space and provide a starting point for those looking to learn more.

It's time to build the new web.
